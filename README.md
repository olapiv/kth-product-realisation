# High Pressure Water Tap

Building a water tap with a reduced surface area for higher pressure and integrated brushes.

# Progress

1. [v1](./v1.stl)
    + Brushes to clean whilst water comes out
    + Brushes & grid holes are way too small
    + Threads are far too thick
    + Radial grid holes not optimal - just one big hole in middle
    + Takes too long to print (for prototype)

1. [v2](./v2.stl)
    + Testing M22x0.5 threads (way thinner)
    + Removing cone for quicker print
    + Removed brushes for quicker print
    + Square grid for constant padding between holes
